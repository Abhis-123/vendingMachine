# Vending Machine
This is a Java project that simulates the functionality of a vending machine. It was developed using object-oriented programming principles, including encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
## Features
 - Accepts coins of different denominations (e.g. nickels, dimes, quarters)
 - Allows users to select a product and dispense it upon payment
 - Keeps track of inventory and displays available products
 - Provides change to users if necessary
## Getting Started
To run this project, you will need to have the following installed on your machine:
 - Java SE Development Kit (JDK 11)
 - Eclipse IDE or another Java development environment
Once you have these tools installed, you can clone or download this repository and open the project in your IDE. From there, you can run the Main.java file to start the program.

## Classes
This project consists of the following classes:

 - Main: The main class that handles user input and controls the flow of the program.
 - Vending : The wrapper class for all functionalities 
 - Item: A class that represents a product available for purchase in the vending machine.
 - Coins: A class that represents a coin accepted by the vending machine.
 - Transaction: A class that manages the inventory of products and coins in the vending machine.
## Future improvements
There are a few areas where this project could be improved:

  - Allow the user to enter money using a virtual keypad instead of inserting physical coins
  - Add more product options
  - Implement a system for restocking the vending machine when inventory runs low
